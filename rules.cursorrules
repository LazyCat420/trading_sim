Rules:
THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IS ALWAYS CONSOLE LOG AND DEBUG UNTIL YOU FIX THE ISSUE. ONCE THE ISSUE IS FIXED REMOVE THE CONSOLE LOGS TO PREVENT TO CODE FROM BEING TOO MESSY AND LAGGY. 
1. Project Structure and Planning
Define Requirements: Clearly outline what data needs to be collected, how it will be displayed, and any specific user interactions required.

Choose Stack: For simplicity and reliability, you might use a combination of:

Backend: Python with FastAPI

Frontend: Next.jswith React

Databases: SQLite for regular data storage and ChromaDB for vector database storage for the chatbot

2. Database Design
SQLite Schema: Design your SQLite database schema to include tables for stock market data, user information, and any other required entities.

Tables: Example tables might include Stocks (id, symbol, name, price, date, volume), Dividends (id, stock_id, amount, date), and Users (id, username, email, password).

Relationships: Clearly define relationships between tables, such as user-specific watchlists.

ChromaDB Usage: Use ChromaDB to store and retrieve vector data for chatbot responses. Structure the data to facilitate efficient querying and retrieval based on user interactions.

3. Backend Development
Set Up Environment: Set up a virtual environment and install necessary dependencies (FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy for ORM, ChromaDB).

API Design: Design RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations and data retrieval:

Create: Endpoint to insert new stock data.

Read: Endpoint to fetch stock data, historical data, dividend history, similar stocks, and chatbot responses.

Update: Endpoint to update existing stock data.

Delete: Endpoint to delete stock data.

Data Validation: Implement data validation to ensure data consistency.

Authentication & Authorization: Implement JWT-based authentication for secure access.

4. Frontend Development
UI/UX Design: Create wireframes/mockups to design a user-friendly interface. Use tools like Figma or Sketch.

Component Structure: Define a clear component structure with React components for displaying stock data, user login, historical charts, dividend history, and chatbot interactions.

State Management: Use state management libraries like Redux to handle application state.

API Integration: Use Axios or Fetch API to integrate with the backend. Display data in tables or charts using libraries like Chart.jsor D3.js.

Error Handling: Implement user-friendly error handling to manage API errors and user input validation.

5. Data Handling and Storage
Cron Jobs/Scheduler: Set up cron jobs or task schedulers to fetch stock market data at regular intervals using yfinance.

Data Parsing: Implement parsers to process and store data into SQLite database.

Vector Data: Store and retrieve vector data using ChromaDB for chatbot interactions.

Data Aggregation: Aggregate data as needed for various analytical or reporting purposes.

6. Testing and Deployment
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for backend APIs and frontend components.

Integration Testing: Test the integration between frontend and backend.

Deployment:

Backend: Deploy backend on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

Frontend: Host frontend on services like Netlify or Vercel.

Databases: Ensure SQLite and ChromaDB are properly configured and backed up.

7. Best Practices and Strategies
Security: Implement security best practices like HTTPS, secure token storage, and input sanitization.

Code Quality: Follow coding standards and best practices. Use linters and formatters.

Documentation: Maintain clear documentation for APIs, codebase, and user guides.

Scalability: Although SQLite is great for small projects, consider future scalability with databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
